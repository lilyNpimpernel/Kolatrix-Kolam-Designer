# KOLATRIX 🎨  
**Digital Preservation & Pattern Analysis of Kolam Designs**

KOLATRIX is a prototype system for digitizing traditional **Kolam designs**, analyzing their underlying geometric structure, and recreating them in reusable digital formats.

---

## 🌿 Overview

Kolam is a rule-based geometric art form created using continuous strokes around dot grids.  
This project focuses on understanding Kolam not just as an image, but as a **structured design system** governed by symmetry, continuity, and spatial constraints.

KOLATRIX explores the transformation of hand-drawn Kolams into **clean vector representations** while enabling structural analysis and pattern discovery.

## ✨ Features

### 1️⃣ Kolam Preservation & Vectorization
- Accepts hand-drawn Kolam images as input  
- Detects dot grids and stroke layouts from uploaded designs  
- Converts Kolams into scalable **SVG/vector formats** suitable for reuse and archiving  

### 2️⃣ Structural & Pattern Analysis
- Analyzes geometric properties such as dot placement, stroke flow, and symmetry  
- Identifies recurring motifs and structural patterns within Kolam designs  
- Bridges visual design with computational representations of Kolam rules  

### 3️⃣ Similar Design Retrieval
- Compares processed Kolam structures to identify visually and structurally similar designs  
- Enables exploration of pattern variations across different Kolams  
- Useful for study, inspiration, and digital archival systems

## 🚀 Design Vision & Research Direction

KOLATRIX is designed as a foundation for **computational Kolam intelligence**, focusing on:

- Formalizing Kolam rules such as **dot-grid topology, stroke continuity, and symmetry constraints**
- Representing Kolams as **parametric and graph-based structures** instead of static images
- Enabling algorithmic and learning-based approaches for:
  - Kolam classification  
  - Style differentiation  
  - Rule-preserving generative Kolam synthesis  

This direction supports applications in **cultural preservation, generative art, education, and design automation**.
