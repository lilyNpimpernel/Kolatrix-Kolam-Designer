# KOLATRIX 🎨  
**Digital Preservation & Pattern Analysis of Kolam Designs**

KOLATRIX is a prototype application focused on digitizing traditional **Kolam art** and enabling visual pattern analysis using **API-based image processing**.

---

## 🌿 Overview

Kolam is a geometric art form created using continuous strokes around dot grids.  
This project explores how Kolam designs can be **preserved digitally**, **converted into reusable formats**, and **analyzed for visual similarity**.

---

## ✨ Features

### 1️⃣ Kolam Preservation (SVG Export)
- Upload kolam images for digital preservation  
- Converts designs into clean, scalable **SVG / vector formats**  
- Enables reuse of patterns for learning, archiving, and design applications  

### 2️⃣ Pattern Identification (API-based)
- Uses external image processing APIs to analyze kolam designs  
- Identifies visual and structural patterns within uploaded images  
- Serves as a foundation for future rule-based and ML-driven analysis  

### 3️⃣ Similar Image Retrieval (API-based)
- Integrates image similarity APIs to find visually related kolam designs  
- Helps users explore variations and references from existing patterns  
- Useful for comparison, inspiration, and digital archiving
